    """Reference Frames that the beachbot robot uses. Note that the vehicle frame is
    lifted from the Ublox Automotive vehicle frame definition and is defined as follows.

    28.6.4.2 Vehicle-Frame
    The vehicle-frame is a right-handed 3D Cartesian frame rigidly connected with the
    vehicle and is used to determine the attitude of the vehicle with respect to the
    local-level frame. It has the following features:
    â€¢ The origin (O) is the VRP in protocol versions less than 19.2, otherwise, is the
        origin of the IMU instrumental frame;
    â€¢ The x-axis points towards the front of the vehicle;
    â€¢ the y-axis points towards the right of the vehicle;
    â€¢ the z-axis completes the right-handed reference system by pointing down.
